                    Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is warmer than the 
                    air and we can use this to heat your home. HT Green can engineer a solution to fit 
                    your situation to give you free plentiful home warming energy year-round. Geothermal 
                    power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but haspreviously 
                    been geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries.
                    Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable 
                    resources, especially for direct applications such as home heating. Geothermal wells tend to 
                    release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower 
                    than those of conventional fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the potential to 
                    help mitigate global warming if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels.

                    If you have the space and the aspect, we have the know-how to engineer a wind turbine 
                    system that generates electricity when the wind blows. Team a wind turbine with a 
                    solar PV system and you increase your energy generation potential. New to wind power?
                    HT Green can show you more about how a wind turbine works, the benefits of wind energy 
                    and how a wind turbine is installed. If you're not sure on the type of turbine you need, 
                    before you buy from us, contact one ofour wind power experts for the right advice.
